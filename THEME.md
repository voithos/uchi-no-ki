## Ideas

A Telepathic RPG. Puzzle game. Maybe multi character control, coordination?
  Time-delayed control of characters (warrior, archer, mage). Could be step /
  turn based for simpler implementation?

B Puzzle (platformer / metroidvania, or grid based?) where two characters are
  trying to unite. Can control each character in turn, solving puzzles

C Shared HP? "Defend your heart" top-down shooter, where you are tethered to a
  heart and share HP. Can move it, but slowly, and must defend it. Goal is to
  get to end of a level

D Metroidvania where two characters are joined with a tether, can only be far
  away for short periods of time. "Joined" state is main state, but
  tether-based movement can be used to go into areas that are otherwise
  inaccessible, to trigger traps/puzzles, fight certain enemies, etc.

E Space docking simulator. Dock modules onto a space station, with precision.
  Sometimes multiple modules involved, must be docked simultaneously, etc

Going with D.
